<p class= "paragraph 1">There once lived a little papaya. He was a happy little one, and his name was Papaya. One day while Papaya was chillin’ he was plucked from the tree which he had known his whole life. He was then tossed into a basket with the other Papayas that had fallen victim to the mysterious hand. Papaya was confused because he didn’t know where he was, but the elderly papayas knew and so they told the little papayas about the ancient evil of the farmers. The little ones were scared and began screaming using communicative chemicals, begging to be released. But the farmer did not notice nor would he have cared in the first place, because to the farmer, all they were was fruit. The screaming continued for a long time, even as more papayas fell from the sky. Until suddenly the basket began moving again. The basket moved for miles and miles, and the papayas rumbled and tumbled in the basket for hours and hours. Until finally, the basket stopped moving and the rumbling stopped. Then the farmer reached his hand into the basket, pulled out a papaya, opened his mouth, and began eating it! To the papayas, who did not know what he was doing, it seemed as if an evil monster was digging white daggers into their friend’s skin, puncturing his soft exterior and exposing his insides until blood oozed out of his lethal wounds. Swiftly and gruesomely the papaya shrunk in size, while spilling his insides onto the floor of the basket, as he screamed his final remarks. Until all of a sudden the screaming stopped and all that was left of Patrick the papaya was guts, and icky yellow blood. Papaya looked down at his friend's remains, stunned and horrified at what he had just witnessed. It felt as if Patrick was still screaming, fighting for his life. This event would haunt Papaya forever, like a scar on his emotions, never fading and never weakening. Next the hand reached for Papaya, and he braced as the hand caught grasp of his stem and Patty the papaya screamed in horror, knowing what was to come of Papaya. But after a few seconds Papaya realized that the hand that had picked him up had actually just laid him on a table. He breathed a sigh of relief and, realizing he was out of danger, went back to absorbing sunlight. A few minutes later, the farmer picked up Papaya again and handed him to a small human. Papaya was confused and began screaming as the little human opened its jaws of death. Papaya breathed what he thought was his last breath of carbon dioxide. But no, Papaya lived, because as the little human opened its mouth a scientist walked by and offered him some money in exchange for the little Papaya. Then the scientist took Papaya in his hand and began walking with him. Was Papaya scared of him? No. Did Papaya scream? No. Why wasn’t Papaya scared of him? We don’t know. Papaya simply felt safe around the scientist, he felt that there was something about him that seemed harmless. Was he right? Yes. The scientist then put him in a box, a cool box, in stark contrast to the blazing hot sun that had been beating down on Hawaii for the past summer. Papaya was glad, for outside the sun was so hot that it made Papaya feel like he was boiling alive (which may have been the case considering he is a fruit made of fluids). Then the scientist picked up the box, loaded it into his car, and drove away. A few hours later, the car stopped and the scientist picked up the cooler. He walked the cooler over to his desk and sat it down right next to his chair. He typed something on his computer, then he pushed some buttons, then he pulled a lever, and then he opened a small little door leading to a chamber. After he did all of that, he opened the box and picked up Papaya. Then he placed him in the little chamber, and injected him with a vaccine against the Papaya Ringspot Virus. He ran a few instruments, flipped a few switches, and then turned to his colleague on the other side of the room and he said: “We’re ready.” And with that he stuck an instrument onto Papaya’s skin, and closed the door to the chamber. Then Papaya’s chemical signals suddenly begun to appear on a screen in the room. Papaya was confused as to why the scientists were exclaiming, over a screen lighting up. But shortly after thinking this, the scientists began communicating with him using a small machine that transmits communicative chemicals. He was shocked and overjoyed that he could finally communicate with other creatures besides fruit. Papaya explained his struggles and of the horrible experience he had been through earlier that day. So in response to hearing this the scientist turned off the machines, picked up Papaya, placed him back in the cooler, and drove off towards the local farmers market. There the scientist walked up to the papaya stand and bought them all! This made Papaya’s day and pretty soon he and the scientist began making plans to bring justice to papayas. It started off small, occasionally going out and buying all the papayas in sight. But in a matter of months, Papaya and the scientist devised a plan to bring justice to all plants. So they began making artificial food that looked like, tasted like, and had the same nutritious value of the edible plants they were based off, and began selling them across the nation. They then started prompting petitions to end the sale of plants and animals for food purposes across the globe. They were getting thousands of signatures by the day for a long time before the world leaders decided to go ahead with a global reform to the food system. Shortly after this reform Papaya began to fade away, as do many papayas at this age. But the scientist developed an ingenious chemical cure to save his amazing friend, and Papaya lived! The two went on with many more petitions spanning many more years, until finally the last reform. The one that changed the entire world, which was a complete eco-friendly reform. No more of anything that harms the Earth. And after many scientific experiments, a way to achieve a completely eco-friendly world was achieved and the petition was signed. The world itself changed in one year, because of a little papaya and his friend.
